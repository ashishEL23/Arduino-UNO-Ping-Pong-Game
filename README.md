Arduino-UNO-Ping-Pong-Game
An Autodesk Tinkercad simulation of ping pong game in an Arduino UNO development board. This is a simulation of a ping pong game made in Tinkercad with the Arduino Uno.

There are two pushbuttons for player 1 and another two for player 2. These buttons serve as the paddle. For visual feedback, there are two LEDs in this project. If a player has won, the LED will turn green; otherwise, it will turn red. Additionally, a buzzer is connected to digital pin 10 that generates two beeps at the end of the game.

Key Components: Arduino Uno, NeoPixel LEDs, piezoelectric crystal, resistors, pushbuttons, potentiometer, 16Ã—2 LCD display, breadboard

Arduino libraries required:

1.LiquidCrystal.h (https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/LiquidCrystal/)
2.Adafruit_NeoPixel.h (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)
